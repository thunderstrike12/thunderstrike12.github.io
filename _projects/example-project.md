## Overview

A comprehensive analytics platform featuring real-time data visualization, machine learning predictions, and interactive charts. Built with React and Python backend.

## The Challenge

Modern businesses need to make data-driven decisions quickly. Traditional dashboards often lag behind real-time events and don't provide predictive insights.

## My Solution

I built a full-stack dashboard that:

- Streams data in real-time using WebSockets
- Uses TensorFlow models to predict trends
- Visualizes complex datasets with D3.js
- Provides an intuitive interface for non-technical users

## Technical Highlights

The frontend is built with React and uses D3.js for custom visualizations. The backend runs on Python with FastAPI, connecting to a PostgreSQL database and serving ML predictions from TensorFlow models.

## Results

- 40% faster decision-making for the client
- 95% prediction accuracy on key metrics
- Reduced data analysis time from hours to minutes
