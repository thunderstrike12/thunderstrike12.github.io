## Overview

In this team project I worked on a [videoball](https://store.steampowered.com/app/277390/VIDEOBALL/) inspired game with 12 people. I worked on the gameplay which is partly showcased on the itch page, but more importantly, we wanted a very dusty look to the game, so I worked on dust clouds. I started with a prototype in the template engine I had used in a previous raytracing project, also featured on this site. This time, instead of raytracing I marched through a 3D noise. After succesfully making a prototype, I moved a version of it to UE5. On the itch page the dust can be seen in action.
