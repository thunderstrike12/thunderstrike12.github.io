## Overview

In this custom engine project, I initially worked mostly on the animations. I implemented GLTF loading for animated blender models, and animation playing on those models via scripting.

And below you can see the animations in action in a demo we made before working with designers and artists. This demo runs on PS5.

We then started working with designers and artists. At this point, I started working more on gameplay features. This game is released on itch and runs on windows and PS5.
